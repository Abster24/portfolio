            <p>My name is Abigail Snyder. I am a graduate of Liberty University with a bachelor's degree in Web and Mobile Programming. Even though I am just starting out, I am excited to finally be working in my field and put my skills to use!</p>
            <p>I am a web developer with a passion for creating beautiful and functional websites. My journey in web development started a few years ago when I took a Python programming class in highschool, and since then, I have been continuously learning and improving my skills.</p>
            <p id="item3">I specialize in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I love working on projects that challenge me to think creatively and solve problems. I have a particular passion for creating websites for churches, small businesses, and non profits. I have spent a lot of time researching the 
                specific needs and requirements for websites of this kind, and I enjoy the unique challenges that they present. </p>
